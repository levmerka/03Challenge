This is my generate password Challenge in progress
I will be updating for a resubmission in the following week

I created various functions to achieve the seperate tasks of Upper case and numeric character for use in the randomizer; these were set to be global in the .js
i hooked the button the alphabet variable so far and next will be the numeric, lower case, and special character variables I will be creating.
I used a randomIndex function to jumble the characters each time the button is clicked.
